# Augustus Client Features List
## What is this?
This essentially is just a fun little repository I decided to make to help people understand more about Augustus Client's features.

Augustus Client is a Minecraft "utility" client with over 200 modules and several thousand customizable settings for modules.

## Notices
- I got this idea from muffinmaker and his wiki, so go check it out if you can!

- This repository is not completely finished, so consider contributing if possible.

## Modules
todo: add modules when i get home (i dont have access to augustus on my phone xd)
